**BATS - Boston ASL Template and Simulator**

The Boston ASL Template and Simulator is an adult average perfusion template based on Arterial Spin Labeling acquisitions readily available in the MNI space
The template was built using ANTs multi-variate template construction framework (https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs) and based on high-resolution, 1.6mm isotropic ASL data acquired in 10 healthy volunteers using a background-suppressed, variable-density Cartesian PCASL-FSE sequence at 3T.
In addition, BATS also features templates of Arterial Transit-Time based on low-resolution multi-delay ASL data and high-resolution quantitative T1 and T1-weighted, as well as T2-FLAIR data.
